## Premium vs Non-premium
Surprisingly, there wasn't much of a difference in skip behavior between premium and non-premium users.
For non-premium users, 2501 songs were not skipped, and 2738 were skipped. For premium users, 10,396 songs were not skipped, and 11,233 songs were skipped.
See `results/table.premium.png` for the raw data.

## Factor
User_start variable clearly influences, context has slight influence, others none

## Numeric
time of day: skip least when asleep
